Trinity is a minimal init system and service manager for Cypher. It is a lightweight, dependency-aware system and service manager designed for minimal overhead and robust boot management. It functions as the PID 1 process on Cypher, taking on the critical roles of system initialization, service supervision, and process control.

Key Features
**1. PID 1 (Init System)**
As PID 1, Trinity is the initial process spawned by the kernel. It is responsible for starting all other system services and processes.
It adopts orphaned processes and "reaps" them, preventing them from becoming zombies and consuming system resources.

**2. Dual Persistent/Ephemeral Boot Mode**
Trinity offers two distinct and selectable boot profiles:

**Persistent Mode:** The traditional mode where services and configurations are loaded from the standard system directories (e.g., /etc, /usr/lib). Changes made to the system (e.g., installing new software, modifying configuration files) persist across reboots.

**Ephemeral Mode:** A minimal, stateless boot where the system mounts a temporary filesystem for configuration and runtime data. Changes are discarded on shutdown, making it ideal for testing, secure environments, or rapid deployments. The core system files typically remain read-only.

**3. Service Management**
Trinity provides a robust framework for controlling system services:

Standard Operations: Offers clean and reliable commands for starting, stopping, restarting, reloading, and checking the status of services.

Service Supervision: Continuously monitors running services. If a service unexpectedly terminates, Trinity can automatically attempt to relaunch it based on its configuration.

**4. Dependency-Aware Management and Start Order**
A critical feature for reliable system boot and operation:

Dependency Resolution: Services often rely on other services or system resources (e.g., a web server requires the network to be up). Trinity automatically reads service configurations to determine these dependencies.

Correct Start Order: Ensures that services are only started after their required dependencies are fully operational. This prevents boot failures and race conditions, leading to a much faster and more reliable system startup.



**5. Minimalism**
Trinity adheres to the philosophy of being small and efficient:

Low Overhead: Designed with a small footprint, consuming minimal memory and CPU resources, which is particularly beneficial for embedded systems or resource-constrained environments.
Focus on Core Functionality: Prioritizes essential system and service management tasks, avoiding the inclusion of non-critical features to maintain simplicity and speed.
